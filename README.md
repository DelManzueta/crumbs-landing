Technologies Used
THCrumbs is built using modern web development technologies, including:
•	React: a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
•	Framer Motion: a React library for creating smooth animations and interactions.
•	React Intersection Observer: a React library for detecting when elements enter or exit the viewport.
•	CSS Modules: a CSS file format that allows for local scoping of class names, preventing collisions with other styles.

These technologies are being used to create a seamless, user-friendly experience for customers visiting our website. React is the backbone of the application, handling the rendering of components and managing state. Framer Motion is used for creating smooth animations and interactions, adding a layer of polish to the user interface. React Intersection Observer is used to detect when elements enter or exit the viewport, allowing for animations to trigger at the appropriate time. CSS Modules are used to prevent class name collisions and make it easier to manage the styles of individual components.


Folder Structure

src/ components/ Info.js img/ styles/ global.module.css App.module.css App.js index.js

CSS Modules

THCrumbs uses CSS Modules to allow for local scoping of class names. This prevents collisions with other styles and makes it easier to manage the styles of individual components. In addition, it allows for more efficient use of selectors, as styles are only applied to the specific component they are intended for.


Expandability

THCrumbs was built with expansion in mind. The folder structure and component architecture make it easy to add new features and functionality to the application. In addition, the use of modern web development technologies makes it easy to keep the application up-to-date and maintainable in the long term.
